# About
The Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) tool is used to ping IP addresses with large packets to check network vulnerabilities.

The code is made in batch (.bat) so it should run on every Windows computer without installing anything.

It's a simple tool for pinging networks, use it for anything you want.

I recommend putting the program in a folder.

And the code is open source.

do what you want with it, but mention me in it please.
